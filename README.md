# IPI
Inverse Prediction Intervals: Simple codes for calculating uncertainties associated with inverse prediction using linear regression models. 

The script "IPI_estimates" is the file to run.  

The files:  "Generate_data.R", "def_IPI_func", "mod_2stage_cal.stan", "mod_2stage_IP_1miltinewy.stan" should be stored in the same folder as "IPI_estimates", with that folder set as R's working directory.
