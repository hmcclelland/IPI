# IPI
Inverse Prediction Intervals: Simple codes for calculating uncertainties associated with inverse prediction using linear regression models. 

Original description is given with paleoclimate proxy examples (McClelland et al., 2021; https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL092773). Please cite the original publication for any use of this code. 

The script "IPI_estimates" is the file to run.  

The files:  "Generate_data.R", "def_IPI_func", "mod_2stage_cal.stan", "mod_2stage_IP_1miltinewy.stan" should be stored in the same folder as "IPI_estimates", with that folder set as R's working directory.  

This script typically takes around 1 hour to complete with current settings on most computers.
